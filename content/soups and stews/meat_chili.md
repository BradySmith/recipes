## Ingredients
+ 2 pounds ground meat
+ 1 pound maple smoked bacon

+ 4 cloves of garlic
+ 4 chopped and seeded jalape√±o peppers
+ 2 cans of diced tomatoes
+ 2 cans maple beans
+ 1/4 cup brown sugar

## Directions
Divide the spices into three equal parts. 

Brown the meat, seasoning it lightly with salt and pepper.  Cook the bacon until slightly crisp.  Drain the fat, crumble, and cook with the onion and garlic, until they are soft. 

In a crock or stock pot, add the bacon/onion/garlic mixture.  Add the diced tomatoes (with juice), beer, coffee, tequila, tomato paste, and hot sauces.  Add in the browned meat, and stir it all up.

Add your chilis, first third of spices, and brown sugar.  Bring to a simmer.  After two hours, add the second third of spices, and the maple beans.  Finally, just before serving, stir in the final third of spices.  

Serve in bowls, topped with shredded cheese.
