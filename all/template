Directions

    Paragraph-style instructions go here.  They are at most 75 characters 
wide, and each line is followed by a carriage return.  Each period is also
followed by two spaces, just because I'm fussy like that.  

    This formatting will make it easy to print these someday, as well as 
fitting on a standard text editor page.
